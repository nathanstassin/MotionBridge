## Overview
For detailed installation and usage instructions, visit the [project page](https://nathanstassin.com/motionbridge)

MotionBridge is a workflow automation tool that bridges the gap between Adobe After Effects and Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve. It enables motion designers and editors to work efficiently across both applications by synchronising compositions, markers, and renders, eliminating traditional export/import bottlenecks.

### Key Features

- **🔗 Composition Linking:** Bidirectional links between AE comps and DaVinci timeline nests
- **📍 Marker Synchronisation:** Share editorial notes, animation timing marks, and comments between apps
- **🎞️ Smart Render Management:** Render in one click from After Effects with templates, then refresh renders in DaVinci in one click
- **🗂️ Project Organisation:** Each project maintains its own motionbridge folder with auto-organised folders in apps and on disk

---

## Requirements

- **DaVinci Resolve:** Studio V20+ or Free V19.0.3
- **After Effects:** CC 2025 or later
- **Operating System:** macOS, Windows
